<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><br />
  Executive producer&nbsp;Russell T Davies&nbsp;revived&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;after a 16-year absence with the successful premiere of &quot;Rose&quot;  in 2005. Following the BBC's announcement of a second series being  commissioned, the story broke that&nbsp;Christopher Eccleston, who played the titular&nbsp;Ninth Doctor, would not be returning for the second series. On 16 April  2005, the BBC announced that David Tennant had been selected for the role of  the Tenth Doctor. His first appearance in the series was for 20 seconds  following the Ninth Doctor's regeneration at the end of &quot;The  Parting of the Ways&quot;. His first full episode as the Doctor, barring an  appearance in a &quot;mini-episode&quot; during the 2005&nbsp;Children in Need show, was the 2005 Christmas  Special, &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;. He then appeared in the&nbsp;2006 series, the second&nbsp;Christmas Special, the&nbsp;2007 series, the third&nbsp;Christmas Special, and the&nbsp;2008 series. Rather than a traditional series run, 2009 features a  series of five specials and a series of animated shorts, all starring Tennant  as the Tenth Doctor; he also guest-starred in a&nbsp;two-episode serial&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>The Sarah Jane Adventure </em>&nbsp;spin-off in that year. Tennant also appears in two animated serials;&nbsp;<em>The Infinite Quest</em>&nbsp;is counted with the third series, and&nbsp;<em>Dreamland</em>&nbsp;is counted amongst the  2008-10 specials.</p>
<h2><br />
  Personality </h2>
<p>  The Tenth Doctor generally displays a light-hearted,  talkative, easy-going, witty, and cheeky manner, but repeatedly demonstrates a  vengeful and unforgiving streak as well. This emerged early on when he sends  the&nbsp;Sycorax leader&nbsp;(who is attacking him from behind) falling to his death while commenting  that, with him, there are &quot;no second chances&quot;.&nbsp;In &quot;School Reunion&quot;, he acknowledges that he is less  merciful than he used to be and has stuck to his &quot;one warning&quot; code,  punishing his enemies if they persist in their hostilities. This is  demonstrated in &quot;The Runaway Bride when he drowns the Empress of&nbsp;Racnoss'&nbsp;children and stoically watches on, prompting&nbsp;Donna Noble&nbsp;to declare that he needs  somebody to stop him, and in &quot;The Family of Blood&quot; where he  gives each Family member an individual and eternal punishment. His strong  personal sense of justice makes him quick to anger when he feels it is  violated, as in &quot;New Earth‚Äù when he learns of the plague farm run  by the Sisters of Plenitude, he brings down their entire operation. When Prime  Minister&nbsp;Harriet Jones&nbsp;gives an order to destroy the retreating Sycorax ship against his  intentions, he brings down her government in six words, &quot;Don't you think  she looks tired?&quot;, which reaches the press via her assistant's&nbsp;headset. In &quot;The Waters of Mars&quot;, he goes so far as to  declare himself above the laws of time, although there are catastrophic  consequences as a result</p>
<h2><br />
  Appearance </h2>
<p><br />
  The  Doctor complains that his tenth incarnation is not &quot;ginger&quot;. He wears  his own brown hair in various ways throughout the series: unstyled in &quot;The  Christmas Invasion&quot;, a 1950s-style quiff in &quot;The Idiot's Lantern&quot;,  and flattened forwards in &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;. He has dark brown eyes  and is perceived by most, including companions and other characters as  &quot;slim and a little bit&nbsp;<em>foxy</em>&quot;<br />
  He generally wears either a dark brown (with  blue pinstripes) or a blue (with rust red pinstripes) four-buttoned suit, a  shirt and a tie, a light brown faux-suede overcoat (which he claims was given  to him by&nbsp;Janis Joplin,  and different colored pairs of trainers, depending on his suit. According to an  interview on&nbsp;<em>Parkinson</em>, David  Tennant and Russell T Davies got the idea for the Tenth Doctor's costume from  an outfit&nbsp;Jamie Oliver&nbsp;had worn on&nbsp;<em>Parkinson</em>&nbsp;just after  Tennant had taken the role.&nbsp;David Tennant has commented that he would vary the combination of  the buttons he fastened on his jacket in different episodes.</p>

<h1>Appearances </h1>
<h2><br />
  Television </h2>
<p><br />
  The Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston&nbsp;regenerates&nbsp;into the Tenth Doctor (David  Tennant) at the climax of the 2005 series finale, &quot;The Parting of  the Ways&quot;; he re-introduces himself to his companion Rose Tyler (Billie  Piper) in an&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Children in Need</em>&nbsp;mini-episode. In&nbsp;the Christmas special, he is in a comatose state for most of the  episode, following his regeneration. After eventually waking up, he defeats the  alien&nbsp;Sycorax&nbsp;and saves Earth; in the process, he loses a hand, which regrows owing to  his recent regeneration. Amongst other&nbsp;2006 series&nbsp;adventures, the Doctor and  Rose save&nbsp;Queen Victoria&nbsp;(Pauline Collins) from a&nbsp;werewolf, resulting in the creation of the anti-alien&nbsp;Torchwood Institute. The Doctor shares an adventure with two former  companions, journalist&nbsp;Sarah Jane Smith&nbsp;(Elisabeth Sladen)  and robot dog&nbsp;K-9&nbsp;(John Leeson), before taking on Rose's boyfriend Mickey&nbsp;(Noel Clarke) as a second companion. The series finale takes  place in contemporary London, where modern-day Torchwood is the scene for war  between the evil alien Daleks&nbsp;and parallel-universe&nbsp;cyborgs&nbsp;the&nbsp;Cybermen; saving the Earth costs the Doctor Rose, who is stranded in a  parallel universe, along with Mickey and her mother, in &quot;Doomsday&quot;<br />
  </p>
<h2>Spoofs </h2>
<p><br />
  David Tennant has also made numerous cameo appearances as the  Doctor outside of&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>,  frequently in&nbsp;spoof appearances. Singer  and actress&nbsp;Charlotte Church&nbsp;spoofs <em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;alongside an actor playing the Tenth Doctor in her own&nbsp;<em>The Charlotte Church Show</em>&nbsp;(2006). In an appearance on&nbsp;<em>The Friday Night Project</em>&nbsp;in 2007, Tennant plays a female companion to the Tenth Doctor (Justin  Lee Collins) on the Pink Planet, where they are confronted by the alien Gay  Lord (Alan Carr). When the show became&nbsp;<em>The Sunday Night Project</em>, Catherine Tate appeared in a skit playing the Tenth Doctor.<br />
  </p>
<h2>Literature</h2>
<p><br />
  As the face of the&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;franchise for 2005-10, the Tenth Doctor appears extensively in&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;spin-off media; in the majority of these series, the character simply  takes after the place of the Ninth Doctor, and in turn is replaced by the  Eleventh following the debut of&nbsp;the 2010 series. Novels featuring the Tenth Doctor are all published by&nbsp;BBC Books. The character appears in&nbsp;New Series Adventures&nbsp;novels spanning from&nbsp;<em>The Stone Rose</em>&nbsp;(April 2006) to&nbsp;<em>The Krillitane Storm</em>&nbsp;(September 2009). A number&nbsp;<em>Decide Your Destiny </em>novels were published between July 2007 and March 2008, as well as five  books published as a part of&nbsp;Quick Reads Initiative, a government-sponsored&nbsp;adult literacy&nbsp;project. BBC Children's  Books released their own 10-part series,&nbsp;<em>The Dark smith Legacy</em>, supported by an interactive tie-in website.<br />
  </p>
<h2>Audio drama <br />
  </h2>
<p>As is the case with  the BBC Books novels, the Tenth Doctor replaced the Ninth as the face of the&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;audiobook series, beginning  with&nbsp;<em>Pest  Control</em> in May 2008 and ending with&nbsp;<em>Dead Air</em>&nbsp;in  March 2010. The majority are read by David Tennant, save one read by Michelle  Ryan and two by Catherine Tate. A number of Tenth Doctor novels were also  abridged to become audiobooks, again featuring David Tennant's voice alongside  other cast members such as Freema Agyeman and television series guest stars  such as Georgia Moffett,&nbsp;Reggie  Yates&nbsp;and&nbsp;Anthony  Head; the last of these scheduled is&nbsp;<em>Judgement  of the Judoon</em> for December 2010. </p>
