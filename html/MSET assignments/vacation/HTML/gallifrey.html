<h3> What is in Gallifrey? </h3>
<p> Gallifrey (/'gæl?fre?/ or /'gæl?fri?/) is a planet in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It is the original home world of the Doctor, The Master, and The Rani, as well as other Time Lords that have been seen in the show. It was located in a binary star system[2] within the constellation of Kasterborous, at "galactic coordinates ten-zero-eleven-zero-zero by zero-two from galactic zero centre</p>
<h3> wh go to Gallifrey? </h3>
<p> HUGE Doctor Who fan. Who wouldn't want to travel to Gallifrey and see where the Doctor came from? The orange skys and the Time Lords, this seems like an excellent vacation to me. I just hope I go WAYYYYYY before the Time War so I don't get stuck in time and space in an unkown location.</p>
